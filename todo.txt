1. Add basic SEO foundations

You need to implement what Wix does automatically:

✔ Meta tags per page

Use next/head:

import Head from "next/head";

<Head>
  <title>My Portfolio</title>
  <meta name="description" content="..." />
  <meta name="og:image" content="/og.png" />
</Head>


Or use metadata in Next 13+ App Router.

✔ Canonical tags
<link rel="canonical" href="https://yoursite.com/page" />

✔ Sitemap

Install a generator like:

next-sitemap (most popular)

npm install next-sitemap


Configure and it generates sitemap.xml + robots.txt on build.

✔ Schema.org / Structured Data

Wix auto-adds this for businesses.
For Next.js, create a JSON-LD block:

<script type="application/ld+json">
{ ... }
</script>


Or use next-seo.

2. Add dynamic content management (“the Wix editing experience”)

A pure static Next.js site means you must edit code every time you change content.
Wix solves this through a visual editor.

To approximate that:

Option A — Add a headless CMS (recommended)

Examples:

Sanity (great for portfolio)

Contentful

Strapi

Notion-as-CMS (super simple)

This gives you:

Editable text/images

Blog posts if you want

Portable content across builds

This alone makes a Next.js site feel way closer to Wix.

3. Add forms (Wix has them built-in)

Use:

Vercel Forms (dead simple)

Formspree

React Hook Form + your own backend

For a portfolio, Vercel Forms is perfect.

4. Add analytics (Wix has it built in)

Easy options:

Vercel Analytics

Google Analytics

Plausible

5. Add image optimization

Next.js already gives you next/image — better than Wix.

6. Add basic caching + performance

Next.js does most of this automatically.
Vercel deploys SSR/SSG pages with proper caching headers.

You do NOT need additional tuning unless you do something advance
